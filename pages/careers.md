# Full Stack Designer

Design requires building things to serve humans in meeting their needs. Currently, we pay too much for health care in the United States, so our near-term objective is to reduce the price of health care. 

Our organizational need is to make the experience of reducing health care price fun, efficient, and informative for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial officers we are aiming to reach with our $100k+/year Google AdWords spend. These CEOs and CFOs will be reached by our campaign (built with lifelongcrush.com, our brand strategists) or our growth strategy (built with lek.com, our growth strategists helping develop sustainable business models around our open source AI offerings). These CEOs and CFOs need to feel safe, informed, and empowered when they approach their local hospital (we have a database of all hospitals: https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/onefact/paylesshealth/data/main). These CEOs and CFOs will then need to use our information about hospital prices and health outcomes in an area, and employ methods such as active listening and motivational interviewing to negotiate the bundled rates for the biggest line-items on their employees' explanations-of-benefits (e.g. a firefighter union might need a discount on back surgeries; a teacher's union might need a discount on cesarean sections or carpal tunnel surgery). Throughout this specific set of user journies, design will be the secret sauce that most empowers these players in reducing the information asymmetry that sustains our inequitable health system. 

After building payless.health, we will then work with you to systematize the creation of other web properties where reducing the information asymmetry can have a global cascading effect on the hierarchies of needs of people worldwide. For example, we also work in education (thelatepass.org) and discourse (parrot.report) as focal areas of global need. The artificial intelligence technology we build to support these needs must be designed in a full stack fashion, so your lived experience and the lived experience of your friends and family counts. We want your full self at this job, and trust you to tell us if any parts of your self or selves feel unwelcome :)

## Location

Anywhere; we chose Brooklyn as our headquarters for optics, status, and function: New York City's clout as a central _axis mundi_ for health (many academic medical centers), education (many high schools and universities), and discourse (outlets such as the New York Times). 

This enables us to access spaces we otherwise would not be able to that are required to complete our mission.

Several of us work in a hybrid setup, and work in-person from our coworking space in the Brooklyn, New York location.

Attendance required and travel compensated for offsites once a year, in-person. We do our best to avoid the pitfalls of hybrid (such as mainly remote team members feeling left out or disengaged), so if you choose to do this we will ask for a lot of feedback on how you feel about it.

## Responsibilities

Across thelatepass.org, parrot.report, and payless.health, datathinking.org we need to ensure a consistent visual grammar and design language to represent our brand values and corporate values (some listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/102S83njIH54zrV9dEkp0E59S7ESQWyVv1XjGZ9ftXbA/edit?usp=sharing)).

To this end, a Full Stack Designer will play a role in the One Fact Foundation that includes the following responsibilities:

* Maintaining best practices and highest standards for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, static HTML requirements that are consequences of our search engine optimizatino-driven growth strategy (such as incremental static regeneration and client-side compute). 

* Designing the [technical roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5pirByWU0k2PWulDAPF3Z6JHAj2VQ938vFFRLWwVyc/edit?usp=sharing) and aligning it with the [design roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1duoCI6L4z_vvz52XVliQW4h-SATzMAQ4L8O7lgIRFgI/edit?usp=sharing) and [media strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QfvIilGWRBsFluMGHA428tAf8omE7Mxg9Ss8Gb2uUy8/edit?usp=sharing) for a human-computer generated visual grammar and design language. This design language will speak to someone even if someone receives a link and sees the `PNG` image in iMessage or WhatsApp (as we are automating the generation of these images).

* Designing a scalable vector-based search engine (prototype here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OYMSjRmwvQUT7pO1YOB4Kal9Hm_HSZuJ?usp=sharing) for payless.health.

* Designing and helping implement Short Messaging Service and iMessage high-touch user journies and interactions with an automated GPT-enabled agent and the population we hope to reach that is disadvantaged (economically, health equity wise, low self-efficacy, needs help with activities of daily living).

* Hiring team members to help with aspects of the technical and design roadmap that the Full Stack Designer feels they need help with.

## Salary

We follow https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values and are raising a philanthropic round after initial funding from Columbia University and Stanford University's Brown Institute, running workshops and training faculty in health AI for the National Institutes of Health, running our course development and teaching at University of Pennsylvania and University of Tartu.

Thanks to this set of activities, we currently pay a part-time & contractor staff a flat salary of $46.80/hour. As we raise this upcoming philanthropic round, we are targeting $100k/year salary for everyone. This sets the tone for teamwork and transparency throughout our organization. (We're even making our accounting public! Using double entry plain-text accounting software such as `beancount` :). 

## Must-have Background

Familiarity with relying on large language models such as ChatGPT and CoPilot to automate menial tasks such as creating email templates, transforming data, visualizing data, fixing HTML/CSS bugs in incremental static regeneration at scale, or gluing together AWS, Vercel, NextJS, DuckDB, Penpot, Figma and other tools in our stack.

## Nice-to-have Background

Given our hybrid, in-person, and remote work environment, the ability to communicate clearly in writing is essential. 

## Why is it hard to find a candidate for this role? 

It is difficult to find people familiar with open source principles such as those embedded in Bellingcat, Propublica, Consumer Reports, Vital Strategies programs such as simple.org or the Signal Technology Foundation's work that includes signal.org – familiarity with any of these organizations would help!
