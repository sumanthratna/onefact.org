As a social worker, I am dedicated to promoting health equity and supporting both individuals and communities through the current mental health crisis. In my work and personal life I have witnessed many instances where people have not been able to access quality mental health care and treatment due to their lived experience, identity, or zip code. I am happy to support One Fact Foundation to further its mission of making a significant impact on reducing health inequities in the mental health field by advancing research, education, and innovation in mental healthcare through developing and sharing open-source AI tools and technologies that can improve accessibility and outcomes for under-served populations.
