As an individual who has grappled with the daunting task of securing appropriate healthcare for an aging parent living with Parkinson’s in the United States, I've come face-to-face with the complexities embedded in our healthcare system. This experience has led me to participate in a charity bike ride, all in support of OneFact, a remarkable nonprofit which harnesses the power of open source AI. The goal? To make healthcare more accessible, decipherable, and efficient for all of us.

In essence, OneFact's mission is a beacon of hope. The organization is devoted to crafting innovative AI technologies with the intent to streamline healthcare processes. Why? So our healthcare providers can allocate their precious time where it truly matters - engaging in meaningful dialogue with patients. This mission strikes a chord deep within my heart.

In a world where information is power, it's paramount that we all have unfettered access to the knowledge needed to advocate for our health, take timely action when necessary, and empower our providers to concentrate on areas of highest value. So, join me, and together, let's pedal for a cause that will revolutionize healthcare as we know it.
