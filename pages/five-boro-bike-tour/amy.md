Hi there! My name is Amy Beth Killoran, and I'm thrilled to finally be participating in the "TD 5 Boro Bike Tour." This event has been on my bucket list for years, and this year, I'm especially honored to be riding in support of the One Fact Foundation. 

As someone who has had to navigate the healthcare system for years, I've seen firsthand the injustice that comes with the lack of quality, affordable healthcare. The pandemic has only highlighted the deep-seated issues in our healthcare system, and I'm proud to be riding for a cause that's dedicated to improving access to healthcare for everyone.

I know times are tough for many of us, and you may not be able to donate at this time. But I want you to know that every bit helps, and I'm grateful for any support you can offer. It means the world to me to have a community of people behind me, cheering me on as I embark on this journey.

Thank you for being a part of my journey, and I hope you'll continue to follow along as I take on the TD 5 Boro Bike Tour in support of the One Fact Foundation.
