I'm stepping up with the One Fact Foundation Team, driven by a firm belief: knowledge holds power. In our American healthcare landscape, where every individual is often left to their own devices, this couldn't be more pertinent.

We've got some of the finest healthcare services on the globe right here. But, here's the rub: not many can readily access it. That's where Jaan and One Fact step into the picture, committed as they are to empowering folks who need care to actually get it.

How are they doing it? By harnessing Machine Learning and AI. In an economic climate that often pulls in the best minds to serve consumerism, selling products and services, I find myself profoundly inspired by One Fact's mission.

Their goal? To use these cutting-edge tools to help everyday people navigate the labyrinthine healthcare and mental health systems. Their aim? To ensure we all get the help we need. It's a mission I can't help but feel passionate about, and it's why I'm here, ready to make a difference.
