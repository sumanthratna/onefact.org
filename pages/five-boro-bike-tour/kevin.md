I'm thrilled to share that I'll be participating in the Five Boro Bike Ride this year! As I pedal my way through this exciting event, I'm also taking the opportunity to support a fantastic cause through onefact.org. This incredible organization is hard at work, harnessing the power of AI to make a real difference in the medical services available to everyone.

The programs at onefact.org focus on several key areas:

Healthcare: By developing innovative AI-driven solutions, onefact.org aims to improve healthcare delivery, reduce costs, and enhance patient outcomes.

Social justice: onefact.org is dedicated to promoting social justice and equality through inventive approaches that utilize AI and data science. Their programs help organizations and communities tackle systemic inequality, fight discrimination, and build a fairer, more equitable world.

By backing onefact.org, I'm playing a part in advancing programs that can genuinely transform people's lives. Moreover, I can't wait to share this experience with close friends during the ride. The Five Boro Bike Ride promises to be a fun, fulfilling journey, and I'm grateful for the chance to merge my love of cycling with my passion for connecting with and helping others.

I'm reaching out to ask for your support in this endeavor. By donating to onefact.org on behalf of my ride, you can contribute to their life-changing programs and make a lasting impact on those who need it most. Remember, no amount is too small to make a difference.

Thank you for considering supporting me and this meaningful cause.
